        <p><b>What:</b> During Phase 1 of CSI, we conducted several interviews with individuals who had experience working on political campaigns. One common theme that emerged from these interviews was the significant role that technology plays in modern campaigning.</p>
        <p>From data collection and analysis to voter mobilization and targeting, technology is a key component of political campaigns. For example, one interviewee mentioned using voter registration databases and demographic data to target specific groups of voters, while another talked about using digital tools to reach out to voters and track their interactions with the campaign.</p>
        <p>However, despite the benefits of technology, there were also challenges and limitations mentioned in the interviews. For example, one interviewee mentioned the difficulties of accessing and using outdated voter registration databases, while another talked about the high cost of survey research and tracking polls.</p>
        <p><i>An example:</i> We interviewed Maya (pseudonym), who spoke about her work on the Obama and Biden campaigns. She spoke energetically, and it was clear that she enjoyed her work and believed strongly in the importance of policy and politics. During the interview, Maya spoke at length about the challenges of working on a campaign, particularly during the pandemic. She talked about the long hours and the pressure to “change the world.” She spoke about how technology had become increasingly important in campaigns, even with all the associated glitches and errors. Despite the difficulties, Maya remained optimistic and focused, always striving to do her best for the campaign and for the candidates. Her dedication was palpable, and it was clear that she valued her work. I was inspired by Maya’s passion and determination, and I left the interview with a renewed appreciation for the role of policy and politics in shaping our world.</p>
        <p><b>So what:</b> The design phase highlighted the complex relationship between technology and political campaigns. On one hand, technology can greatly improve efficiency and effectiveness in reaching voters and gathering data. On the other hand, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as the cost and accessibility of certain tools, as well as privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>It’s important for designers and strategists working on political campaigns to be aware of these challenges and limitations, and to think critically about how technology can be leveraged in effective and ethical ways.</p>
        <p><i>Implications:</i> As a designer, I learned from the interviews the importance of understanding the needs and challenges of my user group. By investigating a user group through interviews and other research methods, designers can gain valuable insights into problems and pain points. This information can then be used to inform the design process, ensuring that the product is tailored to the needs of the user group. As I mentioned above, from my interviews, I began to understand political workers in a way that I would have never before. I learned that by taking the time to understand the context and challenges of their users, designers can create more effective and impactful solutions.</p>
        <p><b>Now what:</b> One of the key lessons I learned from the interviews is the importance of understanding the context and challenges of the user group in the design process. This is especially relevant when designing for campaigns, where the needs and resources of the user group may vary widely.</p>
        <p>This lesson is applicable to a wide range of design situations. However, the specific needs and challenges of a user group may vary depending on the specific context and goals of the project, and designers should be mindful of these differences when applying this lesson to other design situations.</p>
        <p><i>Specific insight:</i> One area I hope to focus on in the future is the development of digital tools that make it easier for campaigns to reach and engage their target audiences. This could include tools for more efficient and user-friendly voter registration databases, innovative polling instruments that reach a wider audience, and tools that help campaigns navigate the complex world of digital advertising. By creating these types of solutions, I hope to help campaign workers achieve their goals more effectively.</p>
        <p><b>Looks like:</b> I chose the image at the top of the document because it represents the intersection of technology and political campaigns. The person working on the computer symbolizes the reliance on technology in modern campaigning, while the campaign posters in the background represent the ultimate goal of these efforts: to reach and persuade voters. Unfortunately, the only image I found was of the Trump campaign.</p>
